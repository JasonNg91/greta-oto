IF file uses following format:
4bit sign/mag quantization:
	1bit sign bit at MSB (0 for positive, 1 for negative)
	3bit mag bits 000~111 represent 1, 3, ..., 15
8bit/sample with I signal (real part) at 4MSB, Q signal (imaginary part) at 4LSB
each byte holds one sample and organized in byte order in IF file

all_signal.bin is a demo IF file with following attributes:
sampling rate: 4.113MHz
IF frequency: 141kHz (the sampling and IF frequency seems strange but it is carefully selected)
length of the signal is 200ms
contains four signal types: L1CA, L1C(data+pilot), B1C(data+pilot), E1(data+pilot)
each signal type includes signal of SV01, SV03, SV05
Doppler of the three SVs are 0Hz, 800Hz and -1300Hz repectively
start of code cycle at 200.2, 300.3, 400.4 code chips after the beginning of the file for each SV respectively
there is NO data modulation on data channel
all pilot channels use Galileo NH pattern (which means L1CP and B1CP do not have correct secondary code, this is DEMO)
